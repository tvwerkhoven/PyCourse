%%% Frames %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Prerequisite knowledge}
	
	This lecture assumes the following understanding of Python
	
	\spacer
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Running Python interactively or as script
		\item Python variables, datatypes, control flow
		\item Aliasing, slicing, data manipulation.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\spacer

	This is covered in the Python 101 lecture.

\end{frame}

\section{Packages}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Package overview}
	Python can be extended with \emph{packages}. Some are included with Python\footnote[frame]{See \url{http://docs.python.org/library/index.html} for an overview}, others have to be installed separately.
	\spacer
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \href{http://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html}{\texttt{argparse}} (py) -- parse command-line arguments
		\item \href{http://docs.python.org/library/re.html}{\texttt{re}} (py) -- regular expressions
		\item \href{http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html}{\texttt{sys}}/%
		\href{http://docs.python.org/library/os.html}{\texttt{os}} (py) -- system tools
		\pause
		\item \texttt{scipy} -- scientific tools
		\item \texttt{numpy} -- scipy core utilities
		\pause
		\item \texttt{pyfits} -- FITS file IO
		\item \texttt{idlsave} -- load IDL \texttt{.save} files\footnote[frame]{http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/savefmt/}
		\pause
		\item \texttt{matplotlib} -- interactive plotting
		\item \texttt{pyds9} -- interface to ds9
		\pause
		\item \texttt{ipython} -- enhanced python shell
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Package overview II}
	Other packages that look promising.
	\spacer
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{h5py} -- HDF5 interface
		\item \texttt{tables} -- managing hierarchical datasets
		\pause
		\item \texttt{pyfftw3} -- bindings to FFTW3
		\item \texttt{mpi4py} -- MPI for Python
		\pause
		\item \texttt{kapteyn} -- The Kapteyn Package
		\item \texttt{vo} -- parse, validate and generate VOTable XML
		\pause
		\item \texttt{pybtex} -- BibTeX-compatible bibliography processor
		\item \texttt{xlrd} -- extract data from Microsoft Excel files
		\item \texttt{sympy} -- symbolic mathematics
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Obtaining packages}
	To get a package, install it in one of several ways:
	
	\spacer
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Package is already installed (Enthought\footnote[frame]{See \url{http://www.enthought.com/products/epdlibraries.php}}, Activestate\footnote[frame]{See \url{http://www.activestate.com/activepython}})
		\pause
		\item Use package manager to install (\texttt{apt}, \texttt{emerge}, \texttt{fink}, \texttt{macports}, \texttt{homebrew})
		\pause
		\item (Manually download and install (not recommended))
	\end{itemize}
	
	\spacer
	\pause
	
	Using a package manager is \emph{always} preferred because of dependencies and updates.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using packages}
	
	To use a package, run \pythoni{import}\verb! <package_name> [as <alias>]!.
	\spacer
\begin{python}
>>> import numpy as N
>>> N.arange(10)
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
\end{python}
	\spacer
	\pause
	You can also import specific functions to the current \emph{namespace}.
	\spacer
\begin{python}
>>> from numpy import arange
>>> arange(10)
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Zernike polynomials}
	
	Zernike polynomials are defined as:
	
	\[
	\begin{array}{lcl}
	Z^{\,m}_n(\rho,\varphi) &=& R^{\,m}_{n}(\rho)\,\cos(m\,\varphi) \! \\
	Z^{\,-\!m}_n(\rho,\varphi) &=& R^{\,m}_{n}(\rho)\,\sin(m\,\varphi), \! \\
